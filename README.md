# Hospital DB SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project represents a comprehensive **Hospital Management Database** designed for practicing SQL queries and demonstrating data handling skills.  
It includes tables for **Patients, Doctors, Departments, Billing, Appointments, and Medical Records**.  
The project covers **real-world hospital scenarios**, such as patient admissions, doctor assignments, department management, billing calculations, and analytics reporting.

This project is ideal for **fresher SQL Developer / Data Analyst roles**, showcasing practical SQL knowledge, database design, and query implementation.
